understanding  OFA_GL_TRANS_PROC();

Procedure: OFA_GL_TRANS_PROC
The procedure OFA_GL_TRANS_PROC is responsible for orchestrating several processes related to general ledger (GL) transactions. Here is a detailed explanation of what this procedure does:

Purpose: The procedure coordinates the creation, transformation, and sending of GL transactions to the OFA system.

Flow:

Initialization:

V_START_DATE is set to the current system date (SYSDATE).
Calling Other Procedures:

CREATE_OFA_RECEIVABLE_TRANS: This procedure is responsible for creating receivable transactions. It likely selects data from relevant tables and inserts it into the JHL_OFA_GL_TRANSACTIONS table.
TRANSFORM_OFA_RECEIVABLE_TRANS: This procedure transforms the created receivable transactions to prepare them for posting to the GL interface.
TRANSFORM_OFA_GL_TRANS: This procedure transforms general ledger transactions. It includes selecting and processing transactions from JHL_OFA_GL_TRANSACTIONS.
SEND_GL_TRANS_TO_OFA: This procedure sends the transformed GL transactions to the APPS.GL_INTERFACE@JICOFPROD.COM.
Logging Job Details:

After completing the process, it inserts a record into the JHL_OFA_JOBS table to log the job details including job ID, name, start date, and end date.
Commit:

The procedure commits the transaction to ensure all changes are saved.





troubleshooting 

If the procedure OFA_GL_TRANS_PROC runs successfully but the data does not appear in 
APPS.GL_INTERFACE@JICOFPROD.COM, you should troubleshoot by checking the following steps and points within the process:

1. Verify Data in Intermediate Tables
Step: Check Data in JHL_OFA_GL_TRANSACTIONS
Ensure that the data intended for transfer is present in JHL_OFA_GL_TRANSACTIONS.

SELECT * FROM JHL_OFA_GL_TRANSACTIONS WHERE <conditions>;

 Step: Check Data in JHL_OFA_GL_INTERFACE
Confirm that the data has been successfully moved from JHL_OFA_GL_TRANSACTIONS to JHL_OFA_GL_INTERFACE.

SELECT * FROM JHL_OFA_GL_INTERFACE WHERE OGLI_PROCESSED = 'Y' AND OGLI_POSTED = 'N';



2. Verify Transformation Procedures
Procedure: CREATE_OFA_RECEIVABLE_TRANS
Check if this procedure correctly creates entries in JHL_OFA_GL_TRANSACTIONS.
Procedure: TRANSFORM_OFA_RECEIVABLE_TRANS
Verify that this procedure correctly transforms the data for further processing.
Procedure: TRANSFORM_OFA_GL_TRANS
Ensure that the transformation logic is correctly moving data from JHL_OFA_GL_TRANSACTIONS to JHL_OFA_GL_INTERFACE.

3. Verify the Sending Procedure
Procedure: SEND_GL_TRANS_TO_OFA
Confirm that this procedure is correctly sending data to APPS.GL_INTERFACE@JICOFPROD.COM.
Check for any errors or issues during the insert operation.

SELECT * FROM APPS.GL_INTERFACE@JICOFPROD.COM WHERE <conditions>;


4. Check Database Links
Database Link: JICOFPROD.COM
Verify that the database link JICOFPROD.COM is correctly configured and operational.
Ensure that you have the necessary privileges to use the database link.


SELECT 1 FROM DUAL@JICOFPROD.COM;

5. Check Logs and Error Messages
Check Oracle Alert Log and Trace Files
Look for any relevant error messages or issues that might have been logged during the procedure execution.
Check Application Logs
If applicable, check any application-level logs for errors or warnings related to the procedure execution.


6. Check Data Consistency and Constraints
Data Constraints
Ensure that there are no data constraint violations preventing the data from being inserted into APPS.GL_INTERFACE.




Troubleshooting Steps Recap:
Intermediate Data Check:

Verify data in JHL_OFA_GL_TRANSACTIONS.
Verify data in JHL_OFA_GL_INTERFACE.
Transformation Procedures Check:

CREATE_OFA_RECEIVABLE_TRANS
TRANSFORM_OFA_RECEIVABLE_TRANS
TRANSFORM_OFA_GL_TRANS
Sending Procedure Check:

SEND_GL_TRANS_TO_OFA
Database Link Verification:

JICOFPROD.COM
Logs and Error Messages:

Oracle alert logs and trace files.
Application logs.
Data Consistency and Constraints:

Ensure no constraint violations.
